There are {five categories} of switches for enterprise networks:

st%%1. Campus LAN Switches // To scale network performance in an enterprise LAN, there are core, distribution, access, and compact switches. These switch platforms {vary from fanless switches with eight fixed ports to 13-blade switches supporting hundreds of ports.}

st%%2. Cloud-Managed Switches // The Cisco Meraki cloud-managed access switches {enable virtual stacking of switches}. They {monitor and configure thousands of switch ports over the web}, without the intervention of onsite IT staff.

st%%3. Data Center Switches // A data center should be built based on switches that {promote infrastructure scalability, operational continuity, and transport flexibility.}

st%%4. Service Provider Switches // Service provider switches fall under {two categories:} aggregation switches and Ethernet access switches. 
{Aggregation switches} are carrier-grade Ethernet switches that {aggregate traffic at the edge of a network}. 
{Service provider Ethernet access} switches feature {application intelligence, unified services, virtualization, integrated security, and simplified management.}

st%%5. Virtual Networking // Networks are becoming increasingly virtualized. Cisco Nexus virtual networking switch platforms {provide secure multi-tenant services} by adding {virtualization intelligence technology to the data center network}.

anchor  %% 4 // Common Business Considerations When Selecting Switch Equipment
st%%Cost // The cost of a switch will depend on the {number and speed of the interfaces}, supported {features}, and {expansion capability.}

st%%Port Density // Network switches must {support the appropriate number of devices} on the network. The port density of a switch refers to the {number of ports available on a single switch}.

st%%Power // It is now {common to power} access points, IP phones, and even compact switches {using Power over Ethernet (PoE)}. In addition to PoE considerations, some chassis-based switches support redundant power supplies.

st%%Reliability // The switch should {provide continuous access to the network}.

st%%Port Speed // The {speed of the network connection} is of primary concern to end users.

st%%Frame Buffers // The {ability} of the switch {to store frames} is important {in a network where} there may be {congested ports to servers or other areas} of the network.

st%%Scalability // The number of users on a network typically grows over time; therefore, the switch should {provide the opportunity for growth.}
st%%Forwarding Rates  // Less expensive, {lower performing} switches can be used at the {access layer}, and more expensive, {higher performing} switches can be used at the {distribution and core layers}, where the forwarding rate has a greater impact on network performance.

quote   %%  The network designer must also consider the issue of uplink bottlenecks: A series of fixed configuration switches may consume many additional ports for bandwidth aggregation between switches, for the purpose of achieving target performance. With a single modular switch, bandwidth aggregation is less of an issue, because the backplane of the chassis can provide the necessary bandwidth to accommodate the devices connected to the switch port line cards.

anchor %% 4 // Router Requirements

Routers use the network portion of the destination IP address to {route packets} to the proper destination. They select an alternate path if a link or path goes down. All hosts on a local network specify the IP address of the local router interface in their IP configuration. This router interface is the default gateway. The {ability to route efficiently and recover from network link failures} is critical to delivering packets to their destination.
Routers also serve {other} beneficial {functions}:

st%%Provide broadcast containment   //  Routers limit broadcasts to the local network.        
st%%Connect remote locations // Routers can be used to interconnect geographically separated locations.
st%%Group users logically by application or department // Routers logically group users, such as departments within a company, who have common needs or require access to the same resources.
st%%Provide enhanced security // Routers can be configured with access control lists to filter unwanted traffic.
        
anchor %% 4 // Managing Devices
{Out-of-band} management is used for {initial configuration or} when a network {connection is unavailable}. Configuration using out-of-band management requires:
st%%Direct connection to console or AUX port
st%%Terminal emulation client

{In-band} management is used to {monitor and make configuration changes} to a network device over a network connection. Configuration using in-band management requires:
st%%At least one network interface on the device to be connected and operational
st%%Telnet, SSH, HTTP, or HTTPS to access a Cisco device

quote %% The hierarchical network design model divides network functionality into the access layer, the distribution layer, and the core layer. The campus wired LAN enables communications between devices in a building or group of buildings, as well as interconnection to the WAN and internet edge at the network core. A well-designed network controls traffic and limits the size of failure domains. Routers and switches can be deployed in pairs so that the failure of a single device does not cause service disruptions. A network design should include an IP addressing strategy, scalable, and fast-converging routing protocols, appropriate Layer 2 protocols, and modular or clustered devices that can be easily upgraded to increase capacity. A mission-critical server should have a connection to two different access layer switches. It should have redundant modules when possible, and a power backup source. It may be appropriate to provide multiple connections to one or more ISPs. Security monitoring systems and IP telephony systems must have high availability and often have special design considerations. It is important to deploy the appropriate type of routers and switches for a given set of requirements, features and specifications, and expected traffic flow.
